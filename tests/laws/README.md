# ⚖️ THE LAWS OF GOSLING

This directory contains **Immutable Regression Tests**.

## RULES FOR AI AGENTS:
1.  **DO NOT EDIT THESE TESTS.** 
    *   These tests define the non-negotiable requirements of the application.
    *   If a test here fails, it means **YOUR CODE IS WRONG**.
    *   You must fix the Application Code to satisfy the Law.

2.  **SCOPE OF PROTECTION**:
    *   `test_law_001_alias_integrity.py`: Protects Artist Merging/Unlinking/Navigation.
    
## HOW TO RUN:
`pytest tests/laws/`

If any test fails, STOP and REVERT your changes.
